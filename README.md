## Gamplay & Story
You're an employee at the Froggenheim Art Gallery who accidently activated the security system, shredding prieceless pieces of art. As a result you've been tasked with putting the paintings back together.

Art Frog-storation is a simple jigsaw puzzle game. You drag and drop fitting pieces together until you've reconstructed the entire pictures. Fitting pieces will snap together.

## Known Issues and Work-Arounds
- the animations might need a bit to load
-  if the dialog has ended and there are no pieces in your puzzle area simply reload and restart the level (should work after 1 reload with firefox, chrome might need 2-3)
- sometimes two groups stuggle to snap together, this can usually be solved by initiating the collision while selecting the most left piece of the most upper row
- if two pieces are overlapping, move them apart by clicking on part of a piece that isn't overlapping (else both are selected)
- if you've completed the puzzle but aren't being sent to the end screen, simply click on the upper left corner piece
